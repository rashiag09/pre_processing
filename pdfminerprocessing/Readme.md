This folder has the code I used for PDFMiner which takes in the reports from google drive, converts into images, which are stored in 'image' folder.

Then it annotates these images, adding bounding boxes accoding to each category and returns two different outputs.

These two outputs are again saved in google drive, which are further used for post processing.

One of these outputs is in image format, saved in 'image2' folder and the other output is in JSON format saved in 'textline' folder.
